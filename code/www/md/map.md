### Maps
<br>
uGeoTagger is an application that let you visualize uTester's profiles on the world map. Once loaded you'll see the following map elements, as shown in the figure below:

1) **Zoom buttons**: the "+" button let you zoom in the map, whereas the "-" button let you zoom out

2) **Fullscreen button**: this button is used to switch to a fullscreen map

3) **Map selector**: these radio buttons let you choose between three different map backgrounds

4) **Control panel**: this draggable panel permits the insert/update of a uTester profile on the map

5) **Pinpoint**: pinpoints are the map elements that display a profile details

<b><p style="color:red;">Starting 20/12/2018, uTest has changed the way you may look at utesters data. Now you should be logged in to be able to see other uTesters stats. uGeoTagger is therefore unable to retrieve the data he was used too. At the moment the project is stopped (until I'll have some time to study the <i>rSelenium</i> package!). You'll still be able to see the data gathered so far.</p></b>

<b><p style="color:red;">Starting 20/10/2019, the project is moved on <i>shinyapps.io</i>.</p></b>
